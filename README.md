# Random Image Viewer (GAN Project Demo)

A minimal web viewer that loads a list of image filenames and displays a random image from the `images/` folder. This repository contains a simple HTML interface (index.html) and a plain-text image manifest (`image_list.txt`) that the page reads to select images at random.

## Purpose
- Provide a tiny demo for viewing images generated by a GAN or any image source.
- Demonstrate a straightforward way to serve static images and choose one at random from a list.
- Be easy to run locally for testing and demonstration.

## Key features
- Lightweight single-page UI (no build tools required).
- Loads image filenames from `image_list.txt`.
- "Refresh Image" button to show another random image.
- Designed to work with any set of image files placed in the `images/` folder.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- A small local web server to avoid CORS issues when fetching `image_list.txt`.
  - Examples: Python, Node, or any static file server.

## Quick setup (Windows / macOS / Linux)
1. Place your images into the `images/` folder inside the project root.
2. Create or update `image_list.txt` with one filename per line (relative to `images/`):
   - Example contents:
     ```
     sample1.jpg
     sample2.png
     generated_001.png
     ```
3. Start a simple static server from the project root:
   - Python 3:
     - Windows / macOS / Linux:
       ```
       python -m http.server 8000
       ```
   - Node (http-server):
     ```
     npx http-server -p 8000
     ```
4. Open your browser to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/
   ```
   and click "Refresh Image" to display a random image.

## Generating `image_list.txt` automatically
- PowerShell (Windows):
  ```
  Get-ChildItem -Name .\images\ > image_list.txt
  ```
- CMD (Windows):
  ```
  dir /b images > image_list.txt
  ```
- macOS / Linux:
  ```
  ls images > image_list.txt
  ```

## Usage
- Click the "Refresh Image" button to randomly pick an image from the list.
- To add/remove images, update the `images/` folder and regenerate `image_list.txt` (or edit it manually).

## Sample images
Below are two example images referenced from the `images/` folder. Replace or add your own images with the same names (or update `image_list.txt` accordingly):

![Sample Image 1](images/sample1.jpg)

![Sample Image 2](images/sample2.png)

(If those files don't exist, add any two images named accordingly, or edit `image_list.txt` to match your filenames.)

## Project structure
- index.html — main UI that reads `image_list.txt` and displays images from `images/`.
- image_list.txt — newline-separated list of image filenames (used by index.html).
- images/ — folder containing image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
- README.md — this file.

  2. Create a branch for your change.
  3. Make small, focused commits and push your branch.
  4. Open a pull request with a clear description of your change.
- Keep changes simple and include usage instructions and screenshots where helpful.

## Troubleshooting
- Blank or broken image:
  - Confirm `image_list.txt` contains correct filenames (no leading/trailing spaces).
  - Ensure the files listed exist in the `images/` folder.
  - Check the browser console for fetch errors (server not started / wrong path).
- CORS or fetch errors:
  - Run a local server instead of opening the file directly via `file://`.
